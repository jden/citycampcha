    bio: >
      Until November 2012, she was a product manager and director of the Obama
      campaign’s technology field office in San Francisco, the first of its
      kind in American political history. In that role she was responsible for
      organizing technologists to volunteer their skills to the campaign’s
      technology and digital efforts. Prior to joining the campaign, she ran
      the Knight Foundation’s 2011 News Challenge and before that was the
      administrative director at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet &
      Society. She is on the board of directors at the Citizen Engagement Lab
      and the Public Laboratory.

      Open Chattanooga is a collaborative between the City of Chattanooga, the
      Chattanooga Public Library and the Open Chattanooga Brigade. The Open
      Chattanooga Brigade empowers citizens with City data to tell stories,
      solve problems, and better interact with their government. A local
      chapter of the Code for America Brigade since 2012, our Brigade is
      seeking creative thinkers, neighborhood advocates, data nerds,
      designers, developers, and entrepreneurs to help develop meaningful
      solutions to local issues. The Brigade is the citizen arm of Open
      Chattanooga and needs the passion and skills to make the Collaborative's
      efforts meaningful.
